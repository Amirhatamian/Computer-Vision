# Computer-Vision

## Computer Vision Project

### Overview
This project implements **Computer Vision** techniques to enable machines to process, analyze, and understand visual information such as images and videos. By leveraging state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and deep learning, the system can perform tasks like object detection, image classification, and facial recognition.

### Features
- **Image Classification**: Categorize images into predefined classes.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and locate objects within an image.
- **Face Recognition**: Detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- **Custom Model Training**: Train models on your own datasets for specific use cases.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Keras
- Pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, ResNet)
